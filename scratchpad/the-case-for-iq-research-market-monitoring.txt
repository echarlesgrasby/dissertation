\section{The Case for Information Quality Research in Market Monitoring}

The same UC Berkeley study identifies a number of different activities that are essential to Market Monitoring; activities that must be learned, over time, from others in the industry that possess institutional knowledge. Such activities include gathering transactional market data for screening, calculating metrics for market power \footnote{Market power is often defined as "the ability of a seller to profitably maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time" \cite{rahimi-sheffrin}.}
and concentration analysis (for example, the classic Herfindahl-Hirschman Index [HHI] or the Residual Supply Index [RSI]), mitigating abuses of local market power by market participants, and performing policy analysis to determine efficient market design \cite{goldman} \cite{gao-bompard-napoli-zhou}. Likewise, other metrics such as Capacity Reserve Margin (CRM) help other areas of energy markets (such as engineering and operations) identify "how reliable and prepared the system has been" in normal operations \cite{jyang}. Metrics such as these aid in planning for the future state of the grid, both in terms of generator and transmission availability.

Data collection, processing, and analysis enables each of these activities, but quality data and the knowledge of how to make decisions on this data are specialized to the market monitoring domain. This study also highlights a pain point in the current design of market monitoring units- where the concepts of data confidentiality and maintaining valid performance metrics are topics of interest that can be difficult to maintain. These directly map to data quality dimensions that IQ-based research can investigate and improve.

In \textit{[an] Overview of Data Quality: Examining the Dimensions, Antecedents, and Impacts of Data Quality}, one of the antecedents that can directly affect data quality is "information overload" \cite{wang-et-all}. This can be especially true in market monitoring where users must derive a decision by "fusing" data from many different sources. In instances where the users are not familiar with the sources, this has the potential to impact both accuracy and trust in the final product. As an example in an adjacent industry (utilities), Dr. Oyoo's work in data validation for power and utilities organizations showed that information quality can often take a secondary position to the development and maintenance of ETL processes \cite{oyoo}. Market monitoring cannot afford to allow accuracy and trust to become second-class citizens in data processing.
