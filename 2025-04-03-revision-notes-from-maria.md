# Proposal Revision Notes from Maria

## Chapter I (Introduction)

Just as a heads up, if you want to get ahead of me, here are my notes after reading the lit review section
 
Okay â€“ I would restructure the intro so that you have:

1. BES
2. Markets
3. Fall of Enron and creation of MM/energy act
4. What is market monitoring

## Chapter II (Literature Review)

Then, I would start a new section, and just call it the case for IQ research in MM

* Connect back to your introduction, and start by talking about the skills a MM needs
* Talk about challenges of the job:
  * Talk about the different tasks of a MMU
    * Cite literature or mention a body of literature that you intend to use about multitasking, skill diversity, etc
  * Talk about esoteric nature of electric market knowledge
    * Cite literature or mention body of literature you intend to use about highly specialized jobs/topics
  * Talk about the data landscape and its complexities
    * Cite literature or mention body of literature you intend to use that speaks to IQ generally and papers that have specifically applied IQ to energy problems
  * Talk about turnover, aging
    * Cite literature or mention body of literature you intend to use about aging and turnover as a case for IQ
* Talk about DSLs, etc
